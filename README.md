Vizscorer continues the effort started with paletteR to increase the level of quality of the average plot produced in companies where there is no time to study data visualization theory.

It basically:

- looks at ggplot internals 
- analyzes them and 
- produces a deck of slides showing an overall evaluation and detailed suggestions about how to improve the plot.
