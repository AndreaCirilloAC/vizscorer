pie_chart;pie charts are rarely the better way to display data, since makes difficult to make precise comparison between categories. Why do not simply look for a well defined horizontal bar chart?;you are using a pie chart
number_of_layers;you are trying to show too many elements at once, why do not split your plot into more plots or introduce some facet? Look at <code>facet_wrap</code> for further info;you are trying to show too many things at once
number_of_dimensions;you are showing three dimensions on a two dimension support. This can give a quick comparison of values of your data  ,but is not as well suited for accurate or precise lookup. it would be better to split it into two different plots, for instance employing <code>facet_wrap</code>;showing more than 2D on a 2D space is difficult
number_of_bins;the histogram you specified is not the best possibile visualisation of your data. I have found that setting bins to a different width produces a better visualisation of your data structure. Look for the  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman-Diaconis_rule'>Freedman-Diaconis rule</a>  to understand how to set the optimal width of your bins;try to pick a better width for your bins
flipped_barplot;humans are better able at comparing lengths when showed horizontally. Unless you are showing time-related information (i.e. time series over the x axis) try to flip your bars adding <code>coord_flip()</code> to your plot specification;let's flip your bars down!
need_for_a_smooth;it seems a strong correlation is going on between your data. Try to help the reader of your plot spotting it adding <code>geom_smooth()</code> to your plot;you should highlight trends going on
sufficient_number_of_data;your plot shows less then 20 data points. You would obtain a better result employing a table. You can find more info about this within one of masterpieces about data visualization: _The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_ by E. R. Tufte;too few points for a plot
overplotting;you are incurring in __overplotting__: there are too many points to be displayed at once in an accurate way. you should consider introducing some faceting. If you rather want to maintain the current structure of the plot you could consider employing a different geom like <code>geom_bin2d()</code> able to better avoid overplotting;your plot is crowded due to overplotting
use_of_heavy_background;you are employing the default ggplot theme. while it is generally fit for its purpose you should consider removing that grey background, which lowers your data to ink ratio. Please find more info about data ink ratio on the <a href='https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio'>official info vis wiki page</a>;try to remove the grey background
filled_barplot;you are using monochromatic filled bars. that great amount of black neither show any additional data nor convey significant message. consider change it into a <code>geom_point()</code> or a <code>geom_point_range()</code>;the filling of your bars is not adding information
presence_of_title;your plot is missing a title. this makes harder for your reader to understand its content. try to add a title employing <code>labs(title = 'relevant title')</code>;what is a book without a title?
presence_of_subtitle; your plot is missing a subtitle. Subtitle are effective in providing additional relevant info about metrics and data showed in your plot.Try to add a plot employing labs(subtitle  = 'your subtitle');let us understand your plot better with a subtitle
presence_of_caption;your plot is missing a caption. While not mandatories , captions are used to provide info about sources and reference period of your plot. This is crucial to increase the level of graphical integrity of your plot;use caption to add integrity to your plot
special_characters_in_label;your labels shows special characters. this makes them hard to read and reduce their effectiveness. try to solve this explicitly setting your labels trough labs(x  = 'meaningful x axis' = ,y  = 'meaningful y axis');special characters in labels lower readability
outliers_not_labelled;I have found some outliers in your data  ,and they do not seem to be explicitly labeled in your plot.To increase the level of meaningfulness you should consider labelling them;mark that outliers
